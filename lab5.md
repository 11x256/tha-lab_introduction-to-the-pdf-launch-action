#### BONUS EXERCISE

1. In this lab we utilized Adobe Reader Version 9.3.0, as it was the last version of Adobe Reader that didn’t safe guard against the launch actions, but all of the labs we performed in this module will also work in Adobe Reader Version 9.3.3. In the next PDF learning module I will show you how to do this, but feel free to research the internet and play with the above labs to see if you can’t get around the safe guards in Adobe Reader Version 9.3.3 before I show how too.

2. Opening web pages, notepad, and the windows calculator are interesting demo’s, but really don’t do anything for us as a penetration tester, so I would challenge you to come up with some ideas of how the launch action could be utilized in a penetration testing attack scenario. Of course we will get to this in future labs, but again feel free to experiment on your own.

3. Adobe Reader 9.3.0 allows us to control the warning message box, which I did not show you how to do in this lab. Can you figure out how to do this on your own? Again don’t worry if you can’t as I will show you in an upcoming PDF related module, but don’t wait on me give it a shot. 

4. You have completed this block of instruction.
